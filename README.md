# FFWC Enhancement

This repository contains the code used to support the
analysis for enhancement of the FFWC hydrological forecasts.

## Directory structure

The code in this repository is organized as follows:

```shell

├── analysis      # Main repository of analytical work
├── src           # Code to run any relevant data acquisition/processing pipelines
|
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt

```

## Reproducing this analysis

Create a directory where you would like the data to be stored,
and point to it using an environment variable called
`FFWC_DATA_DIR`.

Next create a new virtual environment and install the requirements with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you would like to instead receive the raw data from our team, please
[contact us](mailto:centrehumdata@un.org).

## Development

All code is formatted according to black and flake8 guidelines.
The repo is set-up to use pre-commit.
Before you start developing in this repository, you will need to run

```shell
pre-commit install
```

You can run all hooks against all your files using

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

It is also **strongly** recommended to use `jupytext`
to convert all Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) to Markdown files (`.md`)
before committing them into version control. This will make for
cleaner diffs (and thus easier code reviews) and will ensure that cell outputs aren't
committed to the repo (which might be problematic if working with sensitive data).
